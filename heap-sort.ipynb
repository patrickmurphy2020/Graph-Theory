    "Heap sort divides the array into two distinct regions <i>Sorted</i> and <i>Unsorted</i>. At first every element is in the unsorted region and the sorted region is left empty. The largest elemnt is the chosen and added to the sorted region. The elements in the unsorted region can be visualized as a binary tree"
